It's always like that: 
there is only one that matters. Little Bubble is travaling along side a long pipe of tunnel. 
He doesn't know where he is at, and all he can see is some sort of funny looking colors 
and ... the rear side of a giantic bubble, who doesn't even speak anything. Probably because he can't see his face.
More to his confusing feeling, he can feel the pushy force behind his, well, rear end.

All of a sudden, a strong suction, flush out the little Bubble. 
And, finally, he can see the beautiful world reveal in front on him.
While little Bubble is so amazed by the scene, a titanic mouth appear from nowhere.
Poor little Bubble's life is over before he knew it.
Eaten.


So, the only thing that matters to any windows on your messy desktop, is the one that need to be paid maxium attention.

So, focus on that window, and hit Ctrl + Shift + h to "Bubble up".

That's all.
