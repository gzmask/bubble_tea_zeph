#####bubble tea for zephyros
It's always like that. There is only one that matters. 


Little Bubble is travaling along side a long and narrow pipe of tunnel. 
He doesn't know where he is at, and all that he can see is some sort of funny looking colors.
And ... the rear side of another giantic bubble, whom he can not see the face of.
More to his confusing feeling, he can feel the pushy force behind his, well, rear end.


...Marching...


All of a sudden, a strong suction, flush out the little Bubble. Up in the air, then little Bubble dropped into a surface.
Finally, he can see the beautiful world reveal in front of him.
While little Bubble is amazed by the scene, a titanic mouth appear from nowhere, licked, then darkness.
Poor little Bubble's life is over before he knew it.


Eaten.
